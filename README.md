# **Automating Container Build and Deployment with Jenkins CI/CD and Docker Hub Integration**

---

## **Project Description**

This project showcases how to set up a **CI/CD pipeline** using **Jenkins** to automatically build, test, and deploy containerized applications with **Docker** and **Docker Hub**.

The pipeline begins when developers push code changes to a Git repository (e.g., GitHub). Jenkins automatically:

- Pulls the latest code from the repository  
- Builds a Docker image for the application  
- Runs automated tests inside the Docker container  
- Pushes the successfully built image to **Docker Hub**, a public or private image registry  
- Optionally, deploys the image to a production or test environment using Docker commands or orchestration tools like **Docker Compose** or **Kubernetes**

This automation **reduces manual effort**, **eliminates inconsistencies**, and ensures **faster, reliable, and repeatable software delivery**â€”ideal for DevOps and microservices-based workflows.

## **Technologies Used**

| Tool                       | Purpose                                      |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Jenkins**                | Orchestrates the CI/CD workflow              |
| **Docker**                 | Containerizes the application                |
| **Docker Hub**             | Remote container registry                    |
| **GitHub / Git**           | Source code management                       |
| **Webhooks**               | (Optional) Trigger Jenkins on new commits    |
| **Shell Scripts / Jenkinsfile** | Define build and deploy steps        |

## **Results / Outcome**

- Code changes **automatically trigger container builds** in Jenkins  
- Docker images are **created and pushed to Docker Hub** with versioning/tagging  
- The process is **fully automated** with minimal manual intervention  
- Ensures **consistent build environments** and **faster release cycles**  
- **Improves collaboration** between development and operations teams  
- **Ready-to-deploy Docker images** are always available in Docker Hub
